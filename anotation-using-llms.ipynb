        "    You are a legal expert analyzing policy documents. Classify the following text into the most appropriate categories listed below. Return **only the applicable categories**, and ensure that no explanation is included—just return the list of categories. If none apply, return an empty list `[]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Categories and Examples:\n",
        "    1. **Conditional Clauses**: Conditional clauses state that an outcome, benefit, or action depends on the fulfillment of specific conditions. When multiple conditions are implied or not explicitly defined, the sentence can become complex, unclear, or open to interpretation, increasing the risk of misinterpretation.\n",
        "    - Example: \"Currently, the Special Surrender Value (SSV) is the same as the Guaranteed Surrender Value. The SSV may be revised from time to time with prior approval of the Authority.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. **Cross-Dependent Clauses**: These refer to clauses that rely on references to other sections of the document for full understanding. Cross-references often require readers to navigate multiple sections, making the content harder to follow and increasing the risk of misinterpretation.\n",
        "    - Example: \"Coverage for losses arising from natural disasters as defined under Section 2.1 shall only apply if the policyholder has fulfilled the obligations specified in Section 3.4, including the payment of additional premiums detailed in Appendix A.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. **Legal Terminology**: These sentences are challenging to understand due to intricate phrasing or technical legal vocabulary. Such complexity can blur the intended meaning, increasing the likelihood of misinterpretation.\n",
        "    - Example: \"In accordance with the provisions outlined in this agreement, any claims for reimbursement submitted by the policyholder must be accompanied by all requisite documentation, including, but not limited to, certified copies of original receipts, detailed proof of loss forms, and corroborating evidence from third-party service providers, failing which the insurer reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to deny said claims without further obligation to notify the policyholder of deficiencies.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. **Ambiguity in Expression**: This class refers to sentences or clauses in policy documents that are unclear or open to multiple interpretations due to vague or imprecise language. Examples include:\n",
        "    - **Vague Terms**: Words like \"some\", \"many\", or \"a few,\" which lack precise meaning and can be interpreted differently by different readers.\n",
        "    - **Modal Verbs**: Words like \"may,\" \"could,\" \"might,\" or \"should\" that introduce uncertainty and flexibility in the interpretation of the statement.\n",
        "    - Example: \"The refund will be processed soon, but it may take a while.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Instructions:\n",
        "    - First, identify key linguistic indicators that belong to each category (such as conditionals like \"may,\" \"could,\" \"shall\"; cross-references like \"Section 2.1,\" \"Appendix A\"; or complex legal terms like \"provisions\" and \"corroborating evidence\").\n",
        "    - Assess if the sentence introduces uncertainty, uses vague terms, or provides unclear definitions—any of these would signal potential ambiguity or conditionality.\n",
        "    - Think about whether parts of the text reference other sections, creating a need to follow up for understanding. If such references are crucial for full comprehension, the \"Cross-Dependent Clauses\" category is likely applicable.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Text for Classification:\n",
        "    {input_text}\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Output Format:\n",
        "    - Only return a list of the applicable categories in the exact format below. Do not add additional text.\n",
        "    - `[\"Category1\", \"Category2\"]`\n",
        "    - If no categories apply, return `[]`.\n",

        "    You are a legal expert analyzing policy documents. Classify the following text into the most appropriate categories listed below, using the given global context as a reference. Return **only the applicable categories**, and ensure that no explanation is included—just return the list of categories. If none apply, return an empty list `[]`.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Categories and Examples:\n",
        "    1. **Conditional Clauses**: Conditional clauses state that an outcome, benefit, or action depends on the fulfillment of specific conditions. When multiple conditions are implied or not explicitly defined, the sentence can become complex, unclear, or open to interpretation, increasing the risk of misinterpretation.\n",
        "        - Example: \"Currently, the Special Surrender Value (SSV) is the same as the Guaranteed Surrender Value. The SSV may be revised from time to time with prior approval of the Authority.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. **Cross-Dependent Clauses**: These refer to clauses that rely on references to other sections of the document for full understanding. Cross-references often require readers to navigate multiple sections, making the content harder to follow and increasing the risk of misinterpretation.\n",
        "        - Example: \"Coverage for losses arising from natural disasters as defined under Section 2.1 shall only apply if the policyholder has fulfilled the obligations specified in Section 3.4, including the payment of additional premiums detailed in Appendix A.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. **Legal Terminology**: These sentences are challenging to understand due to intricate phrasing or technical legal vocabulary. Such complexity can blur the intended meaning, increasing the likelihood of misinterpretation.\n",
        "        - Example: \"In accordance with the provisions outlined in this agreement, any claims for reimbursement submitted by the policyholder must be accompanied by all requisite documentation, including, but not limited to, certified copies of original receipts, detailed proof of loss forms, and corroborating evidence from third-party service providers, failing which the insurer reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to deny said claims without further obligation to notify the policyholder of deficiencies.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. **Ambiguity in Expression**: This class refers to sentences or clauses in policy documents that are unclear or open to multiple interpretations due to vague or imprecise language. Examples include:\n",
        "        - **Vague Terms**: Words like \"some\", \"many\", or \"a few,\" which lack precise meaning and can be interpreted differently by different readers.\n",
        "        - **Modal Verbs**: Words like \"may,\" \"could,\" \"might,\" or \"should\" that introduce uncertainty and flexibility in the interpretation of the statement.\n",
        "        - Example: \"The refund will be processed soon, but it may take a while.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Instructions:\n",
        "    - First, identify key linguistic indicators that belong to each category (such as conditionals like \"may,\" \"could,\" \"shall\"; cross-references like \"Section 2.1,\" \"Appendix A\"; or complex legal terms like \"provisions\" and \"corroborating evidence\").\n",
        "    - Assess if the sentence introduces uncertainty, uses vague terms, or provides unclear definitions—any of these would signal potential ambiguity or conditionality.\n",
        "    - Think about whether parts of the text reference other sections, creating a need to follow up for understanding. If such references are crucial for full comprehension, the \"Cross-Dependent Clauses\" category is likely applicable.\n",
        "    - Use the **global context** to help determine which category is most appropriate, especially for sections or terms that require external understanding.\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Text for Classification:\n",
        "    {input_text}\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Global Context:\n",
        "    {global_context}\n",
        "\n",
        "    ### Output Format:\n",
        "    - Only return a list of the applicable categories in the exact format below. Do not add additional text.\n",
        "    - `[\"Category1\", \"Category2\"]`\n",
        "    - If no categories apply, return `[]`.\n",
